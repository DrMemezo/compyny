Gemini-667| This planet reeks of war and fear. You can feel a cold running down your legs 
Lorem-908| You see the broken and ruined shelters in the distance... Something terrible happened here.
Daxter-1289| Wake up captain. Time to experience hell again.
Jasmine-672| The dust and grime make its way to your suit. You feel as if you're being watched
